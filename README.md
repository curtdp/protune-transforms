GoPro Protune Transforms

The following are a series of GoPro Protune Input Transforms (IDT) for DaVinci Resolve.

Depending on the Color Science, they can be used either in ACES or in DaVinci YRGB


## ACEScc / ACEScct

* GoPro_Protune_Native_ACES.dctl - IDT for ACES using Protune (FLAT) Gamma with Native Color Space - with CAT02 Chromatic Adaptation for use in DaVinci Resolve
* GoPro_Protune_Native_Bradford-CA_ACES.dctl - IDT for ACES using Protune (FLAT) Gamma with Native Color Space - with Bradford Chromatic Adaptation
* GoPro_Protune_Rec709_ACES.dctl - IDT for ACES using Protune (FLAT) Gamma with Rec.709 (non-Native) Color Space - with CAT02 Chromatic Adaptation for use in DaVinci Resolve
* GoPro_Protune_Rec709_Bradford-CA_ACES.dctl - IDT for ACES using Protune (FLAT) Gamma with Rec.709 (non-Native) Color Space - with Bradford Chromatic Adaptation


## DaVinci YRGB

* GoPro_Protune_Native_Rec709_Scene.dctl - Input Transform for YRGB using Protune (FLAT) Gamma with Native Color Space - output to Rec.709 Scene
* GoPro_Protune_Rec709_Rec709_Scene.dctl - Input Transform for YRGB using Protune (FLAT) Gamma with Rec.709 Color Space - output to Rec.709 Scene
